          <ul className="ml-4 list-disc md:ml-8">
            <li>
              Trolliey will indicate on relevant product pages and checkout
              pages when Goods are for sale by a Third-Party Seller. In such
              cases Trolliey only provides the platform to facilitate
              transactions between Third Party Sellers and Trolliey customers.
              Trolliey is neither the buyer nor the seller of these Goods unless
              otherwise specified.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Sale formed on acceptance of your order for Goods that are for
              sale by a Third-Party Seller is therefore solely between the
              registered user and such Third-Party Seller. Trolliey is not a
              party to that sale.
            </li>
            <li>
              Not all Third-Party Sellers are registered VAT (Value-Added Tax)
              vendors. Only Third-Party Sellers who are registered VAT vendors
              may charge VAT on Goods sold and issue a tax invoice in respect
              thereof. If a Third-Party Seller is not a registered VAT Vendor,
              it may not charge VAT on Goods sold and will not be in a position
              to issue a tax invoice in respect thereof.
            </li>
            <li>
              Because Trolliey wants the registered user to have a safe and
              consistent experience, Trolliey will handle any returns under the
              CPA by the registered user arising out of or in connection with
              the Sale between a registered user and a Third-Party Seller on
              behalf of the Third-Party Seller according to Trolliey’s own
              Returns Policy. Should such claim escalate into being a dispute,
              although Trolliey is entitled to become involved in an attempt to
              resolve it, Trolliey is not obliged to do so and any disputes must
              be resolved between you and the relevant Third-Party Seller alone.
